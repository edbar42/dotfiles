# Setup

### ⚠️ This repository is still under construction. ⚠️

This is where I keep my configs and dotfiles for my Linux system.

At the moment, these are aimed to work for a fresh installation of [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) with the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window manager. 

FYI, I got some of these configs from [TJ's config repo](https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager/).

# Installation

TO-DO

# Software that I use:
> The full list of software and libraries I use not available by default in EndeavourOS are listed in `scripts/data/packages`.
  
### [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
  More than an IDE, a [PDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg).

  My config was heavily based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), an amazing project to get started with configuring NeoVim for your needs.

### [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
  Because I'm using Lua for `nvim` anyways. 

  Also, it's probably the best terminal I've ever used.

### [mpv](https://mpv.io/)
  [The based gigachad's video player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-g04TLp0tg)

### [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)
  No more GUI for handling files.

### [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)
  Non-bloated and highly efficient document reader with vim like keybindings. 

### [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
  With [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [zoxide].
